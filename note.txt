query.key is the same as query["key"]

"field.key" can handle the case whether the field is an array, and items in the array contains the key.
Note that for projection, "field.key" will include all keys in that field's array.

Skip/limit/sort
cursor.sort({key :1}); 1 means ascending, -1 means desending
Can sort by multiple keys by passing in an array
cursor.skip();
cursor.limit();
The order does not matter, mongodb always sort first, then skip then limit.
better to sort on index

no mongo joins

no declared schema


1NF的定义为：符合1NF的关系中的每个属性都不可再分
只要在RDBMS中已经存在的数据表，一定是符合1NF的
third normal form
要求所有非I傩远贾缓秃蜻xI有相P性，也就是f非I傩灾g是独立oP的

2NF在1NF的基础之上，消除了非主属性对于码的部分函数依赖

living without constraints and transation

atomic
1. restructive, work with single document with atomic opeation
2. implement in software
3. tolerate

1-1
whether to embed
1. frequency of access
2. size of item
3. atomicity of data

1-many 2 collection
1-few can be one collection
to avoid normalisation, embed with many to one

many-many 2 collections

Multikey indexes
ensureIndex()

Embeding benefit
1. improved read performance
2. one rount trip to the DB

represents trees
instead of storing parent id, list the ancestors

storage engine
affects the data file and index format

MMAP, WiredTiger

MMAP offers collections level concurrency- multiple read, single write lock
in place update
power of 2 size


WiredTiger offers document level concurrency
compression of data/indexes
no inplace update


index
(a,b,c)-> you can search by a or (a,b), or (a,b,c)
index creates a BTree, so it will be faster to find item by index, but meanwhile, writes will be slow as it need to maintain BTree.
So add all items, then build index

createIndex, getIndexes(), dropIndex();

Multikey indexes
Cannot have compond index that two indexes are array indexes in one document

{unique:true}
_id is unique although db does not tell you that.

remove item can have option {justOne: true}

sparse index

A sparse index cannot be used for sorting

foreground and background index creation
foreground is fast but blocks read and writes, vice versa for background

cannot explain insert

executionStats, allPlansExecution

covered query -> only need to scan indexes

query plan and cache

working set
memory/disk

Important to fit working set in memory, especially the indexes
stats() to find indx size

geospatial indexes
ensureIndex({"location":"2d", type:1})
$near

2dsphere
#geometry, $maxDistance

text search
ensureIndex({:"text"})
$text:{$search:''}

$meta:'textScore'

hint()
specify the index that we want to use

put quality query key in front of ran

mongo logs slow query

--profile 0,1 or 2
db.system.profile database
db.getProfilingLevel()
db.setProfilingLevel(1)
db.getProfilingStatus()

mongotop

mongostat

sharding
mongos
insert must include entire shard key
if no shard key, then mongos will broadcast, poor performance

aggregation framework
match

sort
skip
